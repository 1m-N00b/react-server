# Router

You can extend the basic functionality of `@lazarv/react-server` with a file-system based router. This allows you to create a file-system based routing structure, similar to other meta-frameworks.

To install the file-system based router for `@lazarv/react-server`, add the `@lazarv/react-server-router` package to your project:

```sh
pnpm add @lazarv/react-server-router
```

After this, you no longer need to specify your entrypoint when using the `react-server` CLI. `@lazarv/react-server` will automatically detect the router and use it. You can start your development server just by running the command:

```sh
pnpm exec react-server
```

Build your application using the file-system based router by using:

```sh
pnpm exec react-server build
```

Start your built production application by using:

```sh
pnpm exec react-server start
```
