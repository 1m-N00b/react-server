# Advanced

In this chapter, we'll cover some advanced topics related to file-system based routing. These are features of the router that you will surely use in a more advanced application, but you might not need in a simple one.

<Link name="layouts">
## Outlets
</Link>

You can add outlets to your layouts by defining routes in a subdirectory of your layout with a name starting with `@`. When the route under your outlet directory matches the URL, the component exported from that route definition file will be passed as a React prop to your layout component.

```sh
src
- (main).layout.jsx
- @sidebar
  - (sidebar).page.jsx
```

```jsx
// (main).layout.jsx

export default function RootLayout({ sidebar, children }) {
  return (
    <main>
      {sidebar}
      {children}
    </main>
  );
}
```

```jsx filename="@sidebar/(sidebar).page.jsx"
export default function Sidebar() {
  return <aside>...</aside>;
}
```

To make outlets available for [client-side navigation](/framework/client-navigation), you can use the `ReactServerComponent` component from the `@lazarv/react-server/navigation` module. But using the file-system based router, the server-side rendering is handled automatically for each outlet. You can fine-tune the navigation of your app by using the [Link](/framework/client-navigation#navigation) and [Refresh](/framework/client-navigation#refresh) components from the same module when using outlets. Combining an initial content using the outlet available as the prop in your layout component and client-side navigation with the `ReactServerComponent` component, you can create a powerful navigation system for your app.

```jsx filename="(main).layout.jsx"
import { ReactServerComponent } from "@lazarv/react-server/navigation";

export default function RootLayout({ sidebar, children }) {
  return (
    <main>
      <ReactServerComponent outlet="sidebar">
        {sidebar}
      </ReactServerComponent>
      {children}
    </main>
  );
}
```

To check out an example using outlets, see the [Photos tutorial](/tutorials/photos#outlet).

<Link name="error-handling">
## Error handling
</Link>

You can define a custom error components by creating a route definition file for any path by using the same rules like normal route files, but named `error.jsx`. This file will be used to render the error component when an error occurs during the rendering of a page.

```jsx
// (root).error.jsx

export default function Error({ error }) {
  return <div>{error.message}</div>;
}
```

You can also define a fallback error component by creating a route definition file for any path by using the same rules like normal route files, but named `fallback.jsx`. This file will be used to render the fallback error component when an error occurs during the rendering of a page and no error component is defined for the error.

```jsx
// (root).fallback.jsx

export default function FallbackError({ error }) {
  return <div>{error.message}</div>;
}
```

<Link name="loading">
## Loading
</Link>

You can define a custom loading component by creating a route definition file for any path by using the same rules like normal route files, but named `loading.jsx`. This file will be used to render the loader component while the page is being fetched.

```jsx
// (root).loading.jsx

export default function Loading() {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```

When you add a loading component or a fallback error component beside your layout, the router will enable partial pre-rendering for the page it renders automatically. To disable partial pre-rendering, add `prerender: false` to your `react-server.config.mjs`. See more details at [Partial pre-rendering](/framework/ppr).

> **Warning:** you can define an error boundy, error fallback or loading component only for layouts, not for pages.
