# Vercel

To deploy to Vercel, use the `@lazarv/react-server-adapter-vercel` package. This adapter is specifically designed to work with Vercel and it's configuration.

## Installation

First you need to initialize your project with Vercel. You can do this by running the following command:

```sh
vercel init
```

At this point you will have a `.vercel` directory with a `project.json` file in it. This file will be used to store the project and organization configuration for your Vercel project.

After you have initialized your project, you can add the `@lazarv/react-server-adapter-vercel` package to your project:

```sh
pnpm add -D @lazarv/react-server-adapter-vercel
```

Then you need to add the adapter to your `react-server.config.mjs` file:

```mjs
export default {
  adapter: '@lazarv/react-server-adapter-vercel',
};
```

## Configuration

Configuration for this adapter will be added to your Vercel `config.json` file so you can use all available Vercel configuration options, like headers, redirects, and rewrites.

## Deploy

When using `@lazarv/react-server` with the Vercel adapter, you can deploy your application to Vercel using the following command:

```sh
pnpm exec react-server build
vercel deploy --prebuilt
```

You can also deploy with the `react-server` CLI by using the `deploy` argument:

```sh
pnpm exec react-server build --deploy
```

> **Warning:** The Vercel adapter only supports static sites at the moment. If you need runtime server-side rendering, stay tuned for updates.
