# Markdown

`@lazarv/react-server-router` supports Markdown out of the box. Not just standard Markdown files, but also MDX and any plugin for both Remark and Rehype.

## Usage
</Link>

To use Markdown or MDX, just create a page with the `.md` or `.mdx` extension. The content of the file will be rendered as a React Server Component.

Create a page named `readme.mdx` with the following content in your root directory for pages:

```md
# Hello MDX!

This is an MDX page.
```

This route will available at `/readme` instantly.

Because your Markdown/MDX document will be rendered as a React Server Compoennt, it will also it support all React features, like client components, loading fallbacks and error boundaries. Like on all standard `@lazarv/react-server-router` pages.

Your parent layouts will also be applied to your Markdown/MDX pages.

> **Fun fact:** This documentation website was also created by using MDX with `@lazarv/react-server-router`.
