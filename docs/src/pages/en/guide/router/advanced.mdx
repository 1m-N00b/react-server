# Advanced

In this chapter, we'll cover some advanced topics related to file-system based routing. These are features of the router that you will surely use in a more advanced application, but you might not need in a simple one.

## Outlets

You can add outlets to your layouts by defining routes in a subdirectory of your layout with a name starting with `@`. When the route under your outlet directory matches the URL, the component exported from that route definition file will be passed as a React prop to your layout component.

```sh
src
- (main).layout.jsx
- @sidebar
  - (sidebar).page.jsx
```

```jsx
// (main).layout.jsx

export default function RootLayout({ sidebar, children }) {
  return (
    <main>
      {sidebar}
      {children}
    </main>
  );
}
```

```jsx
// @sidebar/(sidebar).page.jsx

export default function Sidebar() {
  return <aside>...</aside>;
}
```

## Error handling

You can define a custom error components by creating a route definition file for any path by using the same rules like normal route files, but named `error.jsx`. This file will be used to render the error component when an error occurs during the rendering of a page.

```jsx
// (root).error.jsx

export default function Error({ error }) {
  return <div>{error.message}</div>;
}
```

You can also define a fallback error component by creating a route definition file for any path by using the same rules like normal route files, but named `fallback.jsx`. This file will be used to render the fallback error component when an error occurs during the rendering of a page and no error component is defined for the error.

```jsx
// (root).fallback.jsx

export default function FallbackError({ error }) {
  return <div>{error.message}</div>;
}
```

## Loading

You can define a custom loading component by creating a route definition file for any path by using the same rules like normal route files, but named `loading.jsx`. This file will be used to render the loader component while the page is being fetched.

```jsx
// (root).loading.jsx

export default function Loading() {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```
