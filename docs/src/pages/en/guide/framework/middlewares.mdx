# Middlewares

Middlewares are functions that are executed before the route handler. They can be used for many things, like authentication, logging, parsing, etc.

## Basic usage
</Link>

Export an async function named `init$` from your entry module. This function can initialize your request handler that will be the middleware runner. The `init$` function needs to return with an async function. This function will be the middleware runner.

```jsx
// index.jsx

export async function init$() {
  return async (context) {
    // do something
  };
}
```

You can use all functions available from the `@lazarv/react-server` module in your middleware. You can redirect or rewrite the request, manage cookies or add headers to the response. Everything is available and possible that would be available in a React server component.
