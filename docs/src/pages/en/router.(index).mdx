# Router

When you build a more complex application, you will need a router to handle the routing logic. The `@lazarv/react-server-router` package provides a file-system based router that you can use to define your routes in a simple and declarative way.

This file-system based router is building on top of the framework's built-in low-level routing solutions and it's very easy to use and configure. If you think this router is too much for your needs, you can use the built-in [server-side router](/framework/server-routing) and [client-side navigation](/framework/client-navigation) components of the framework.

[Installing](/router/install) the router is extremely easy and simple. You just need to add the package to your project and you are ready to go.

You can learn about the [basics](/router/basics) of the router on how to configure the router or how to create layouts, pages and different types of routes.

This router also supports creating [server](/router/server) routes that can be used to create API endpoints or middlewares using the file-system and all the rules you already learned in the basics.

There are some more [advanced](/router/advanced) solutions available in the router, like outlets, error handling or loader components.

This documentation is also the best example that you can use [Markdown](/router/markdown) or MDX files as pages in your application. This is a very simple way to create static pages in your application.

Finally you can learn how to generate a [static](/router/static) website using the combination of the router and the framework. You can define all the routes you want to generate and the router will generate the static files for you. Not only for pages, but any static file, like a `sitemap.xml` for your website.
